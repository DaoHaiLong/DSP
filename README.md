   -Audio Steganography: text are embedded into audio file without loss of audio quality, 
    and while extraction can get the embedded text back.

DSP Labwork 1 (Frequency & Time Representation):

# TODO:
	-Install Python (anaconda) and some packages (scipy, matplotlib)
	-Review the tutorial if you are new to python: https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/
	-Carry out the labwork, write a report
	-Submit the report before 11:59PM April 30, 2021

# Signals:
	-plot the signal Input_1kHz_15kHz (in time domain)
	-convert into frequency, plot real/imaginary/magnitude/phase
	-using Inverse-FFT to get back to time domain
	-Comment?

# Systems:
	-plot the Impulse_response
	-convert into frequency, plot real/imaginary/magnitude/phase
	-calculate the output using time convolution/frequency multiplication
	-Comment?

# EGC:
	-plot the signal in time and frequency domain
	-calculate the output using time convolution/frequency multiplication
	-Comments?
