DSP Labwork 1 (Frequency & Time Representation):
#TODO:
	Install Python (anaconda) and some packages (scipy, matplotlib)
	Review the tutorial if you are new to python: https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/
	Carry out the labwork, write a report
	Submit the report before 11:59PM April 30, 2021

Signals:
	plot the signal Input_1kHz_15kHz (in time domain)
	convert into frequency, plot real/imaginary/magnitude/phase
	using Inverse-FFT to get back to time domain
	Comment?

Systems:
	plot the Impulse_response
	convert into frequency, plot real/imaginary/magnitude/phase
	calculate the output using time convolution/frequency multiplication
	Comment?

EGC:
	plot the signal in time and frequency domain
	calculate the output using time convolution/frequency multiplication
	Comments?
